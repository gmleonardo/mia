                They play games in Spanish to reinforce and introduce new

                cover fundamentals. One of my favorite lessons I observed was my

                >
                MIA and Claudia have become like family to us. Her energy and
                genuine love for kids is infectious and pervades her teaching.
                This is the quality that has been most valuable to us and what
                has enabled the kids to continue wanting to learn Spanish.
                Although they have no perceived “use” for Spanish at this point
                in time (no family who speaks it, no friends who know it), their
                motivation to learn is inspired by Claudia’s personality and
                love. When the kids were younger, Claudia used play, cooking,
                crafts, and other activities to introduce and reinforce
                vocabulary. Now she engages them with clever games designed to
                review and learn new vocabulary. As they have advanced in their
                abilities, she helps them read, write and work on grammar skills
                in Spanish. I love that she moves at their own pace and, yet,
                gently challenges them to learn more. We look forward to seeing
                her every week.
